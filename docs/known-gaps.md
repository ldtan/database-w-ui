# Known gaps, gotchas, and follow-ups

Things that are deliberately unfinished, behave in a way that surprises people, or will
bite whoever touches the code next. Ordered by how much they matter.

---

## 1. There is no public registration

`POST /auth/users/` is **administrative** — superuser-only — and it is the only way to
create an account. The first account exists solely because `seed.py` seeds it into an
empty users table. So today a superuser onboards everyone by hand.

Adding public self-signup means a **new** unauthenticated route (`POST /auth/register`),
not loosening the admin one. It needs its own narrower schema: `UserCreate` extends
`UserBase`, so the caller can already set `is_active`, and the model now carries
`is_superuser` — a public route accepting those fields would let a stranger self-promote.
It would also want rate limiting and email verification. Note `UserService.create` already
auto-provisions a personal workspace for every new user, which is the right behavior for
signup.

## 2. A record shared without its list can't be viewed in the UI

The API supports this on purpose — item routes use `resolve_list_or_404` (existence only)
rather than `get_list_or_404` (which requires list `view`). Verified: a user with `edit`
on one record and *no* grant on the list gets 200 on that record and sees only it in the
list's records.

The UI can't render it. `ListDetailPage` is the only place a record appears, and on mount
it fetches `/lists/{uuid}` and `/lists/{uuid}/columns/`, both gated on list `view`. Both
403 and the page blanks.

The blocker is the **column schema**: records are JSONB keyed by column uuid, so a record
is unrenderable without the column definitions — and that endpoint requires exactly the
permission an item-only grantee lacks. Closing this needs a backend change either way:
let an item grant confer read access to the list's column schema (field names and types,
not its records). That is a deliberate widening, not a no-op.

On top of that, pick one:
- **Degrade `ListDetailPage`** when `/lists/{uuid}` 403s (smaller, one page to maintain).
- **A dedicated record page/permalink** (cleaner separation, a second page to maintain).

Both also need two fallbacks that are easy to miss: `RecordFormDialog` renders from a Form
(`/lists/{uuid}/forms/` is *also* gated on list `view`), and `LookupCell` resolves a value
by fetching a **different** list — so lookups must degrade to an unresolved value when the
target list isn't visible.

## 3. Grants are not scrubbed on hard delete

`permission_grants` points at resources polymorphically via `(resource_type, resource_id)`
with **no foreign key**, so nothing cleans up a grant when its resource goes away. This is
harmless today because resources only ever soft-delete and the resolver walks the live
hierarchy (a deleted resource resolves to no context, so its grants are inert). It becomes
a real problem the moment anything hard-deletes, or if ids are ever reused.

## Behavior that surprises people

**`is_superuser` and the permission model are orthogonal.** A superuser administers
*identities* — creating users, promoting them, editing group membership. It does **not**
grant access to anyone else's workspaces, lists, or records; that is entirely the grant
system's business. The reason identity administration has to be locked down at all is that
it sits *underneath* permissions: groups are principals in the grant table, so whoever can
edit membership can hand themselves any grant a group holds, and whoever can reset a
password can simply become the workspace owner. (Both were open to any authenticated user
until this was fixed; `tests/test_account_security.py` keeps them shut.)

**The last superuser cannot be deleted or demoted.** Superusers are only ever minted two
ways — seeded into an empty users table, or promoted by an existing superuser — so losing
the last one locks account administration out permanently, with no migration tool to undo
it by hand. `UserService._guard_last_superuser` refuses; promote a replacement first.

**Changing your own password requires `current_password`; a superuser resetting someone
else's does not.** The first stops a stolen access token becoming a permanent takeover.
The second is a deliberate admin capability — a superuser genuinely *can* take over any
account, which is inherent to the role, not a hole.

**The workspace owner is an implicit superuser** *of their own data* (unrelated to the
`is_superuser` flag above). `effective_actions` short-circuits to all
actions when `user.id == workspace.owner_id`, before any grant lookup. Owners cannot lock
themselves out of their own data no matter how the grants are arranged, and no grant can
*reduce* an owner's access. This is also why the whole pre-existing test suite stayed green
when permissions landed: `DISABLE_AUTH=True` resolves the caller to the seeded owner.

**"Unique" permissions are opt-out, not opt-in.** A record leaves the list's permission
umbrella only when someone flips its `permissions_inherit` to `false`. New records default
to inheriting, so a row added later to a list with carefully-locked-down records is
immediately visible to everyone holding list `view`. There is no "every new row in this
list starts unique" mode. If per-record access is meant to be a list's default posture,
that needs building.

**Breaking inheritance is reversible.** Flipping `permissions_inherit` back to `true`
re-joins the parent chain, and grants made while the child was independent are kept and
simply re-union with the inherited ones.

**`ListRead.workspace` exposes only a uuid, deliberately.** A list can be granted without
its workspace, so serializing the workspace's `display_name` would leak the name of a
workspace the caller was specifically not given access to. This is why the "Shared with me"
section shows the list's own slug as its subtitle rather than "in «Workspace»".

## Gotchas for whoever edits this next

**There is no Alembic.** The schema comes from `Base.metadata.create_all` over the models
imported in `main.py`'s lifespan and `tests/conftest.py`. A new model needs importing in
*both*. `create_all` only ever *creates missing tables* — it will not add a column to a
table that already exists, so an existing dev DB silently keeps the old shape and then
errors at query time. Either recreate the DB, or apply the column by hand; additive
columns are safe to `ALTER` in and keep your data. For example, `is_superuser` landed as:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_superuser boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
UPDATE users SET is_superuser = true WHERE username = 'admin';  -- seed.py only fires on an empty table
```

**Never lazy-load a relationship after a commit.** The session factory sets
`expire_on_commit=False` precisely because a lazy reload under asyncpg raises
`MissingGreenlet`. In particular, `PermissionService` never touches `user.groups` — it
queries `user_group_association` directly, because the `DISABLE_AUTH` user isn't loaded
with groups eager-loaded and the lazy load would blow up outside the greenlet.

**`PermissionService` is imported lazily inside functions, on purpose.** `permissions.services`
imports from `auth.users.services` → `workspaces.services`, so a module-level
`from src.permissions.services import ...` in `workspaces/services.py` or `lists/services.py`
creates an import cycle. The deferred function-local imports in `list_visible`, `ListService.list`,
`ListItemService.list`/`query`, `ViewService.list`, and `FormService.list` are load-bearing.

**The PrimeReact theme hardcodes its colors.** `lara-light-cyan/theme.css` defines
`--primary-color` / `--surface-*` and then never references them (zero `var(--primary-*)`
usages in the file), so overriding those variables recolors nothing. Theming works only
because `themes.css` is a custom, **unlayered** override sheet imported **last** in
`main.tsx` — unlayered rules beat `@layer`ed Tailwind utilities, and last-import wins on
source order. Reordering those imports silently breaks every theme.

**`frontend/src/lib/types.ts` is maintained by hand.** Generated API types were considered
and deferred, so backend schema changes do not propagate — update `types.ts` yourself.

**Permission-gated controls are hidden while their query is in flight.** `useEffectiveActions`
returns an empty set until the request resolves, so buttons appear a beat after page load
rather than showing and then vanishing (which would let someone click a control they don't
have). Grant and inheritance changes invalidate the cached `["effective"]` queries.

**Every read path over records must apply `item_view_filter`.** Per-record permissions are
only as strong as the weakest path that returns records. Export used to miss this — it
streamed rows filtered on `list_id` alone, so a list-viewer could export records whose
inheritance was broken and were never granted to them, even though the grid hid them
correctly. Fixed, and `test_http_export_respects_item_permissions` guards it. Any *new*
endpoint that returns record data needs the same filter; a list-level `view` check is not
sufficient.

**`POST /permissions/effective` is capped at 500 resources per call** (`max_length` on
`EffectiveActionsQuery.resources`). A page showing more rows than that needs to chunk.
